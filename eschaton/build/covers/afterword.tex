\hspace{5mm} At autumn's conclusion in the yards and forests of upstate New York, gone forever are countless foliages of the native angiosperms. In the coming spring their replacements of similar shape, color, and kind will readorn the limbs, the soil, the stems, and perhaps thus be considered descendants, rebirths, reincarnations of the previous winter's dead. But the cycle of progeny is of no similarity to the growth, discard, and replacement of the leaf. So how does this dead end become a cycle in one's perception of a plant, and how does the land swallow up its evidence? \\

\hspace{5mm} How, in the Treaty of Big Tree, does the annihilation of the Iroquois Confederacy become a transfer of land, a leg of the civilization inhabiting current-day Rochester's evolution? How is the stark, immediate cutting-off of an object of ancestry, origin, language, food, dance, paint, sculpture, architecture, music, magic, transfigured to an interpolation, a lineage, a passing-torch between peoples? As the murderers kill their own in turn, an abolitionism becomes a segregation, becomes a gentrification, a stratification of the human beings entitled to home ownership and corporate office work, from those treated as less-than-animal in their relegation to rental housing or, worse yet, alternative constructions of plastic and paper. From whom do these metamorphoses come? Certainly not from time, and certainly not from the motion and collision of animal bodies. \\

\hspace{5mm} The Lampyridae population's waxing and waning down the belt of the American East Coast; the spectrum of the Milky Way's visibility between lightbulb-lit cities and moonlit forests; my old friends and lovers speak of our memories together in terms of proximity, as though assessing how easily the miles between our moments could be retravelled in a blue van heading pastward along an interstate. Are these stories we are told? Perhaps. Are they stories we tell ourselves? Most likely. But despite its cruel fiction, I can find within myself no shame towards the comfort I take drawing an arbitrary procession from genesis to eschaton. And I can find no untruth in a coupling of the widening of space with the persistence of time. \\
